class Saver(object):
  """Saves and restores variables.

  See [Variables](../../how_tos/variables/index.md)
  for an overview of variables, saving and restoring.

  The `Saver` class adds ops to save and restore variables to and from
  *checkpoints*.  It also provides convenience methods to run these ops.

  Checkpoints are binary files in a proprietary format which map variable names
  to tensor values.  The best way to examine the contents of a checkpoint is to
  load it using a `Saver`.

  Savers can automatically number checkpoint filenames with a provided counter.
  This lets you keep multiple checkpoints at different steps while training a
  model.  For example you can number the checkpoint filenames with the training
  step number.  To avoid filling up disks, savers manage checkpoint files
  automatically. For example, they can keep only the N most recent files, or
  one checkpoint for every N hours of training.

  You number checkpoint filenames by passing a value to the optional
  `global_step` argument to `save()`:

  ```python
  saver.save(sess, 'my-model', global_step=0) ==> filename: 'my-model-0'
  ...
  saver.save(sess, 'my-model', global_step=1000) ==> filename: 'my-model-1000'
  ```

  Additionally, optional arguments to the `Saver()` constructor let you control
  the proliferation of checkpoint files on disk:

  * `max_to_keep` indicates the maximum number of recent checkpoint files to
    keep.  As new files are created, older files are deleted.  If None or 0,
    all checkpoint files are kept.  Defaults to 5 (that is, the 5 most recent
    checkpoint files are kept.)

  * `keep_checkpoint_every_n_hours`: In addition to keeping the most recent
    `max_to_keep` checkpoint files, you might want to keep one checkpoint file
    for every N hours of training.  This can be useful if you want to later
    analyze how a model progressed during a long training session.  For
    example, passing `keep_checkpoint_every_n_hours=2` ensures that you keep
    one checkpoint file for every 2 hours of training.  The default value of
    10,000 hours effectively disables the feature.

  Note that you still have to call the `save()` method to save the model.
  Passing these arguments to the constructor will not save variables
  automatically for you.

  A training program that saves regularly looks like:

  ```python
  ...
  # Create a saver.
  saver = tf.train.Saver(...variables...)
  # Launch the graph and train, saving the model every 1,000 steps.
  sess = tf.Session()
  for step in xrange(1000000):
      sess.run(..training_op..)
      if step % 1000 == 0:
          # Append the step number to the checkpoint name:
          saver.save(sess, 'my-model', global_step=step)
  ```

  In addition to checkpoint files, savers keep a protocol buffer on disk with
  the list of recent checkpoints. This is used to manage numbered checkpoint
  files and by `latest_checkpoint()`, which makes it easy to discover the path
  to the most recent checkpoint. That protocol buffer is stored in a file named
  'checkpoint' next to the checkpoint files.

  If you create several savers, you can specify a different filename for the
  protocol buffer file in the call to `save()`.

    The constructor adds ops to save and restore variables.

    `var_list` specifies the variables that will be saved and restored. It can
    be passed as a `dict` or a list:

    * A `dict` of names to variables: The keys are the names that will be
      used to save or restore the variables in the checkpoint files.
    * A list of variables: The variables will be keyed with their op name in
      the checkpoint files.

    For example:

    ```python
    v1 = tf.Variable(..., name='v1')
    v2 = tf.Variable(..., name='v2')

    # Pass the variables as a dict:
    saver = tf.train.Saver({'v1': v1, 'v2': v2})

    # Or pass them as a list.
    saver = tf.train.Saver([v1, v2])
    # Passing a list is equivalent to passing a dict with the variable op names
    # as keys:
    saver = tf.train.Saver({v.op.name: v for v in [v1, v2]})
    ```

    The optional `reshape` argument, if `True`, allows restoring a variable from
    a save file where the variable had a different shape, but the same number
    of elements and type.  This is useful if you have reshaped a variable and
    want to reload it from an older checkpoint.

    The optional `sharded` argument, if `True`, instructs the saver to shard
    checkpoints per device.

    Args:
      var_list: A list of `Variable` objects or a dictionary mapping names to
        variables.  If `None`, defaults to the list of all variables.
      reshape: If `True`, allows restoring parameters from a checkpoint
        where the variables have a different shape.
      sharded: If `True`, shard the checkpoints, one per device.
      max_to_keep: Maximum number of recent checkpoints to keep.
        Defaults to 5.
      keep_checkpoint_every_n_hours: How often to keep checkpoints.
        Defaults to 10,000 hours.
      name: String.  Optional name to use as a prefix when adding operations.
      restore_sequentially: A `Bool`, which if true, causes restore of different
        variables to happen sequentially within each device.  This can lower
        memory usage when restoring very large models.
      saver_def: Optional `SaverDef` proto to use instead of running the
        builder. This is only useful for specialty code that wants to recreate
        a `Saver` object for a previously built `Graph` that had a `Saver`.
        The `saver_def` proto should be the one returned by the
        `as_saver_def()` call of the `Saver` that was created for that `Graph`.
      builder: Optional `SaverBuilder` to use if a `saver_def` was not provided.
        Defaults to `BaseSaverBuilder()`.

  This function takes a `MetaGraphDef` protocol buffer as input. If

  it constructs a protocol buffer from the file content. The function
  then adds all the nodes from the `graph_def` field to the
  current graph, recreates all the collections, and returns a saver
  constructed from the `saver_def` field.

  In combination with `export_meta_graph()`, this function can be used to

  * Serialize a graph along with other Python objects such as `QueueRunner`,
    `Variable` into a `MetaGraphDef`.

  * Restart training from a saved graph and checkpoints.

  * Run inference from a saved graph and checkpoints.

  ```Python
  ...
  # Create a saver.
  saver = tf.train.Saver(...variables...)
  # Remember the training_op we want to run by adding it to a collection.
  tf.add_to_collection('train_op', train_op)
  sess = tf.Session()
  for step in xrange(1000000):
      sess.run(train_op)
      if step % 1000 == 0:
          # Saves checkpoint, which by default also exports a meta_graph
          # named 'my-model-global_step.meta'.
          saver.save(sess, 'my-model', global_step=step)
  ```

  Later we can continue training from this saved `meta_graph` without building
  the model from scratch.

  ```Python
  with tf.Session() as sess:
    new_saver = tf.train.import_meta_graph('my-save-dir/my-model-10000.meta')
    new_saver.restore(sess, 'my-save-dir/my-model-10000')
    # tf.get_collection() returns a list. In this example we only want the
    # first one.
    train_op = tf.get_collection('train_op')[0]
    for step in xrange(1000000):
      sess.run(train_op)

  device assignments have not changed.
